# VocabGame

This is a project I built to help me teach English as a Second Language more effectively to Mandarin speakers.
It takes the form of a simple vocabulary game in which players need to match pictures with a vocabulary word.
They can ask to see the chinese characters for the word and can also listen to an audio prompt.

## Install and run the project

Use git clone https://github.com/SEANYB4/VocabGame.git to clone the repository to your local environment.
Then open the directory in a terminal and run the command python vocabGame.py

Enjoy!!
